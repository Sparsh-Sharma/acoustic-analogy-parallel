Parallel numerical implementation of the acoustic analogy
====================================================================== ==

Parallel numerical implementation of the acoustic analogy of Ffowcs Williams & Hawkings.


Data entry
----------------

The program uses 3 files for data entry, however this data defines the surface of the NACA0012 airfoil
And the pressure flow around the airfoil. Considering that the objective is to calculate the noise generated by the
Around the airfoil, only the number of observers should be changed, so the application was developed
To receive parameters that define the simulation settings.

NACA0012.dat
Pressure_imaginary.in
Real_pressure.in

Parameters for program execution determine the size and performance of parallelism.

| Option | Description |
| ----------- | ------------------------------- |
| -t | Number of threads (default = 1) |
| -o | Number of observers (default = 360) |
| -serial | Activates the serial version (default = false) |
| -parallel | Activates the parallel version (default = true) |
| -output | Activates the output in the discipline default MO644 / MC900 (default = true) |

Example: ./surf -t 4 -o 360 -serial -parallel -output input01


Results
----------

In addition to the output.dat file generated in the discipline standard the results are in the standard Mathematica software to facilitate the presentation of the data.

NACA0012.nb = Representation of the NACA0012 airfoil in the Mathematica standard
PressureAtTeta_input01.nb = Noise generated by pressure around the airfoil
PressureAtPoint_input01.nb = The pressure input data in the Mathematica standard
